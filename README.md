## A note on the fonts

The text font used throughout the scores [Lemon/Milk](https://www.dafont.com/es/lemon-milk.font) is not included in MuseScore, 
so if you open the source files without it installed in your computer it will use a fallback one instead. You'll have to install 
the font from the given link to see them as originally designed.

The music font used is [Bravura](https://www.smufl.org/fonts/), which is included in MuseScore, so you shouldn't have any problem.
